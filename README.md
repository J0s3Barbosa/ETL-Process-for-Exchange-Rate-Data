# ETL Process for Exchange Rate Data

## Introduction

Welcome to the ETL Process for Exchange Rate Data project! This project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) exchange rate data. By utilizing Python and Azure services, our system fetches real-time exchange rate data, processes it into a usable format, and stores it for further analysis. This project is ideal for financial analysts, developers, and data scientists who require accurate and up-to-date exchange rate information.

## Objectives

- **Extract** exchange rate data from a reliable API.
- **Transform** the data into a standardized and easily consumable format.
- **Load** the processed data into Azure Blob Storage for persistence and further analysis.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Azure Function (Timer Trigger)**
   - Schedules and orchestrates the ETL process at regular intervals.
   - Ensures the ETL process runs automatically without manual intervention.

2. **Azure Blob Storage**
   - Used for storing the transformed exchange rate data.
   - Provides scalable and secure storage for the processed data.

3. **Azure Monitor**
   - Offers monitoring and logging capabilities to ensure the ETL process runs smoothly and any issues are quickly identified and resolved.

### Data Flow

1. **Extraction**
   - The process begins with an Azure Function, triggered by a timer, making an HTTP request to a reliable exchange rate API.
   - Real-time exchange rate data for the US Dollar (USD) against various currencies is fetched.

2. **Transformation**
   - The raw data is processed into a standardized format, including details such as the base currency, date, and exchange rates for different currencies.
   - This transformation ensures the data is structured and ready for analysis.

3. **Loading**
   - The transformed data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.
   - Each dataset is stored as a JSON file, named with a timestamp to ensure easy retrieval and versioning.

## Benefits

- **Scheduled Data Updates**: Automatically fetch and process exchange rate data at regular intervals.
- **Real-Time Data**: Access the most current exchange rate information.
- **Automated Processing**: Reduce manual data handling with automated extraction and transformation.
- **Scalable Storage**: Leverage Azure Blob Storage for scalable and secure data storage.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrate the stored data with various analytics and visualization tools for further analysis.

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Account**: Required to create and manage Azure services.
- **Azure CLI**: For managing Azure resources via the command line.
- **Python 3.8+**: The programming language used for the Azure Function.
- **Azure Functions Core Tools**: For developing and testing Azure Functions locally.

### Steps

1. **Azure Function App**
   - Create a new Function App in Azure to host the ETL function.
   - Configure the Function App with necessary permissions and settings.

2. **Azure Blob Storage**
   - Create a Blob Storage account in Azure.
   - Set up a container to store the transformed exchange rate data.

3. **Development and Deployment**
   - Develop the ETL function in Python, focusing on the extraction, transformation, and loading logic.
   - Use a timer trigger to schedule the function to run at desired intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).
   - Test the function locally using Azure Functions Core Tools.
   - Deploy the function to Azure and configure the timer trigger.

4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Use Azure Monitor to track the performance and health of the ETL process.
   - Set up alerts and logging to handle any issues that arise.

### Timer Trigger Configuration

The functionâ€™s schedule is defined by a CRON expression in the `function.json` file. For example, to run the function every day at midnight, set the schedule to `0 0 0 * * *`.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "name": "mytimer",
      "type": "timerTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "schedule": "0 0 0 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- **Financial Analysis**: Financial analysts can use the stored exchange rate data for trend analysis and forecasting.
- **Application Integration**: Developers can integrate the exchange rate data into financial applications and services.
- **Data Science**: Data scientists can use the historical exchange rate data for building predictive models and conducting research.
